<!--

  Thank you for reporting a bug for the Cmder project!
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  Please make sure you read and follow the following instructions
  carefully before reporting bugs, and/or requesting new features.
  
  Make sure that you have:
  
  • Searched for existing issues (including the **closed** ones)
    for the similar problems here:
    
    https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues?q=is:issue
    
  • Read both the README.md and the Wiki:
  
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/blob/master/README.md
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/wiki
    
    (What you may be asking here could already be explained there!)
    
  • Please understand that Cmder uses ConEmu as the default
    underlying Terminal Emulator.  If your issue is regarding
    the **Terminal Emulator**, please visit the ConEmu issues page:
    
    https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/issues?q=is:issue
    
    If there isn't an existing issue, you may open a new one there.
    
    (We don't resolve issues regarding ConEmu here, so please 
     make sure you open the issue in the correct place.)

  • If you would like to ask for guides on how to integrate Cmder with
    your favorite IDE of choice, or how to perform a specific task
    with Cmder, make sure you visit our label section first.
    
    You may already have an answer under the Guides or Questions section.

    For a list of labels, visit:
    - https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/labels

    (Be sure to also check “Closed” issues in the labels section!)
    
  • If you have a request to provide auto-complete support for a new tool,
    please post your request here:
    
    https://github.com/vladimir-kotikov/clink-completions/issues
    
  • If you are having an issue with any of the **upstream technologies**
    that are used by Cmder, please make sure that the issue is reproducible
    _only_ when used in combination with Cmder.
    
    We may not directly address the issues related to the following tools:
       - Clink, the default shell in Cmder
       - ConEmu, the terminal emulator
       - Git/MinGW, which also provide *NIX tools
       - clink-completions, which provide autocompletion
    
    The issues related to upstream technologies are labeled as 👆 [name].
    
    We'll try our best to help you -- but we recommend creating an issue
    specifically at each of the corresponding repositories for the best
    result.
    
    ► Try to reproduce the bug you're reporting, on a stand-alone edition
      of each tool, without using Cmder.  If the bug applies when the
      mentioned tools are NOT used within Cmder, there's a good chance that
      you should open the bug at the corresponding repo instead.
     
  • Lastly, have a look at official documentation for Cmder over
    our website, and our wiki.
